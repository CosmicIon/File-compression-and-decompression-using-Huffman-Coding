This is a sample text file for testing the Huffman compression algorithm.
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters.
This technique produces a variable-length code table for encoding each character in the text.
The algorithm was developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Sc.D. student at MIT, and published in the 1952 paper "A Method for the Construction of Minimum-Redundancy Codes".
This sample text should provide a good mix of characters with different frequencies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Huffman compression algorithm.
